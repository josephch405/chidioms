Throughout Chinese history, a curious collection of idioms passed down through
the generations. These four-character long phrases are called
**成語 - Chéng Yǔ**. Some Chengyu have interesting stories: stories that remain
alive in classrooms, the news, and daily life.

This blog is an effort to:

1. Document and explain Chengyu from a **modern, English perspective**
1. Tell some **fun stories** - after all, only interesting stories survive the
   test of time
1. **Improve my writing** because my literary skills have been vegetating since
   college

Idioms are presented in Traditional Chinese for a more authentic look.
