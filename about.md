Throughout Chinese history, a curious collection of idioms passed down through
the generations. These four characters long phrases are called
**成語 - Chéng Yǔ** - .
Most of these were fairly straightforward, but some Chengyu have interesting
stories: stories that are still alive today in Chinese and Taiwanese
classrooms. They are even part of other Chinese-influenced cultures
(Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese etc). 

This blog is an effort to:

1. Document and explain Chengyu from a **western perspective**
1. Tell some **fun stories** - most of these are pretty amusing and funny to read,
   since only interesting stories survive the test of time
1. **Improve my writing** because my literary skills have been vegetating since college

As a side note - the idioms are presented in Traditional Chinese. They look
prettier in my humble opinion.
