## [WIP]

Throughout Chinese history, a curious collection of idioms passed down through
the generations. These phrases were, invariably, always four characters in
length (except for a few rare ones), and they are called **成語 - Chéng Yǔ**.
Some of these were fairly straightforward

But a lot of them had interesting stories behind them.

Well and alive today as contemporary Chinese and Taiwanese culture

This is an effort to

1. Document
1. Tell some fun stories - most of these are pretty amusing and funny to read,
   as Chinese culture is old and only interesting stories survive
1. Improve my writing because my literary skills have been vegetating since college

As a side note - the idioms are presented in Traditional Chinese. They look
prettier in my humble opinion.
