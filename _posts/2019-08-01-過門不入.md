The ancient [Emperor Shun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Shun) employed
a Master of Works named [Yu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_the_Great),
who inherited the role from his father. The old man could not contain the Great
Floods ravaging China, and was eventually fired - via Imperial Execution
(a reminder to always file your Two-Weeks resignation notice).

Determined not to end up similarly unemployed, Yu dedicated his life to the
waterworks. He worked so hard that he remained single until the age of thirty
(a surprisingly progressive take on the social construct of marriage, really).
He enjoyed his honeymoon - until he left for work again 4 days later. For the
next 13 years, Yu never returned home - ever - despite passing by on three
occasions and hearing the cries of his newborn child. Now that's what I call
hands-off parenting.

The hard work paid off: Yu eventually cured the floods and earned his way to
the throne as the Great Emperor Yu. But were his professional accomplishments
worth sacrificing the priceless joys of family life? Wouldn't we like to know.

**TL;DR**: Yu worked so hard he became a role model for justifying Chinese work
ethics. That, or he was terrified by his wife.
